# Fundamentals of Music: Strings of sounds

- 9/1
- 9/3

## Melody

: principal part of music, that our ears grab onto

1. synonymous with tune & theme
2. melodies can sound open ended or closed ended
3. parts of melodies are called phrases
    a. melody can be just 1 or multiple phrases
    b. can count the measures in a phrase
4. Cadence is a pause that separates phrases
    a. "musical punctuation"
5. motive is a short musical phrase
6. melodic graphing is the drawing of notes, and connecting them with lines
7. can create contrast by using different instruments

### Musical Form

1. lower-case letters for representing small-scale form (phrases)
    a. a -> a' if it appears later, but slightly varied
2. upper-case letters for representing large-scale form (large sectons)

## Harmony

: pitches that sound simultaneously

1. Chord
2. triad is the basic chord using the diatonic or "tonal" system
3. naming of triads
    a. the I chord can be called the tonic
    b. the V chord can be called the dominant (wants to resolve to I)
4. ending on V is like a comma, ending on V I is like a period

### Building triads on Diatonic scale

D major scale: D E F# G A B C# D

Use 1, 3, and 5 from the scale

D F# A is the I chord
B G E       - II chord
F# A C#     - III chord
G B D       - IV chord
etc
