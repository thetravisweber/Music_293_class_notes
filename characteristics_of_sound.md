# Fundamentals of Music: The Four Characteristics of Sound

Every sound has the 4 aspects:
 : Pitch, Volume, Duration, Tone Color

## Pitch

highness or lowness of the sound (the frequency)
labeled by letter names (7 of them; A-G)

### Intervals

1. difference between pitches
2. smallest interval on the keyboard is a halfstep & wholestep
3. most of western music history, halfstep is the smallest recognized interval
4. intervals are labeled as 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th etc
5. To find the label of an interval, Count letters inclusive
    a. ex: A-C is a 3rd, E down to G is a 6th, E up to G is a 3rd
6. This rule includes sharps and flats
    a. ex: A-C# is a 3rd, A-Cb is a 3rd
7. Not an 8th, tis an octave. 13 pitches in an octave. 12 unique

__conjunct vs. disjunct motion__
Conjunct motion uses small intervals
Disjunct motion uses large intervals (3rds and up)

### Scales

: An ordering of pitches that provides the basis of melodies and harmonies in a composition

1. Diatonic scale is the most preferred in the western tradition
    a. 7 note scale
    b. Major scale follows `wwhwwwh`
        - half steps v important
        - all letters should be represented (tho maybe as sharp or flat)
        - ex. F# G# A# B  C# D# E# F#
        - ex. C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C
        - ex. A  B  C# D  E  F# G# A
        - ex. Eb F  G  Ab Bb C  D  Eb
    c. Minor Scale follows `whwwhww`
        - ex. A  B  C  D  E  F  G
2. Choosing between a major or minor changes the mode (major mode || minor mode)
3. Each piece of music has a key
    a. A modulation is a change of key within a piece of music
4. Composer's can use chromatic notes to add tension, and raise interest

## Volume Level

: dynamics

|      name     |   symbol  |     called    |
| :-----------: |  :------: | :-----------: |
| pianissimo    | pp        | very soft     |
| piano         | p         | soft          |
| mezzo piano   | mp        | medium soft   |
| mezzo forte   | mf        | medium loud   |
| forte         | f         | loud          |
| fortissimo    | ff        | very loud     |

1. loud is symbolized by forte (f)
2. soft is symbolized by piano (p)
3. harpsichord was hip before piano, but no volume change
    a. Piano was called piano y forte because you could control volume

## Duration

: relates to rhythm
: is a temporal art; unfolds through time

1. Beat
    a. occur at regular time invervals
    b. there are some beats that strong, and some are weak
2. Beat Patterns
    a. ex: Duple: `SwSwSwSw`
        - Quadruple pattern is just a duple multiplied
    b. ex: Triple: `SwwSwwSww`
    c. can be fast or slow, still the same beat pattern
3. Use vertical lines to separate beat patterns
4. Down beats are the strong beats
5. Meter is the pattern of strong and weak beats (beat pattern)
    a. shown as fraction as the beginning of music
6. Symbols indicate the duration of a note in music
7. Tempo is the speed of the beats
    a. only started indicating in the 1600s
    b. presto is very fast
    c. lento is for slow
    d. largo is even slower

| name      | meaning           |
| :------:  | :---------------  |
| adagio    | slow              |
|andanta    | pm the slow side, but not too slow |
| moderato  | moderate          |
|allegretto | on the fast side, but not too fast |
| allegro   | fast              |
| presto    | very fast         |

## Tone Color

:timbre

### In Western music tradition, there are 4 families of instruments

: we will emphasize instruments traditionally used in orchestra

#### String

: create a sound by causing a string to vibrate

1. often use a bow in the orchestra (bow made with horse hair)
2. pizzicato is plucked, sound very different than bowed
3. main stringed instruments in orchesta (go down in pitch as list goes down)
    a. violin
    b. viola
    c. chello
    d. double bass

#### Woodwind

: vibrating air within a pipe, that escapes through different holes

2 groups: reeded and non-reeded

1. reeds vibrate the air
2. non-reeded sounds more airy
3. clarinet (single reed)
4. oboe (double reeded)
    a. has an opening between reeds
    b. sounds more nasally
5. basoon - deeper (double reeded)
6. flute (non-reeded)

#### Brass

- trumpet, horn, trombone, sometimes tuba

#### Percussion

- make their noise by being struck

2 groups: pitched and unpitched

unpitched: symbols, triangles, snare drum
pitched: xylophone, timpani / kettle drums
