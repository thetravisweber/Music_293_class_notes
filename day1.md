## Class outlineish

3 units, each with their own exam.
First 2 are worth 15%, last one is worth 20%
last exam is cumulative

6 total quizes (2 per unit)
each worth 4%
worst one dropped
20% of total grade
NO making them up

Class attendance is worth 10%
can miss 2 unexcused classes without hurting grade
excused are okay
each unexcused past 2 takes off 5%
3 late = 1 unexcused
